# Secure-Messaging-and-User-Authentication-with-AES-Encryption-and-ML

Over the last few years, much anxiety has been expressed about data security in transmission mainly because of growing include cloud-based systems for messaging and file sharing. Sensitive data, personal or corporate, seems to be vulnerable to interceptions by malicious third parties. Encryption, such as AES, provides inadequate protection of data without other techniques, and weak user authentication systems like password-only authentication allow access by unauthorized parties to encrypted information.

This project proposes a solution to those problems with the incorporation of a much more powerful user authentication system, based on machine learning, which is integrated with AES encryption. It aims to protect the identity of the user as well as the data and limit the opportunity for unauthorized access. Python has been selected based on its rich ecosystem of cryptography and machine learning libraries in particular: cryptography, scikit-learn, and getpass.
